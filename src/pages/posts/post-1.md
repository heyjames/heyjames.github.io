One of the best things I've learned as a self-taught programmer is when I stop coding, is to open a text document and briefly type what I just did, what I am doing, and what I should do next. This simple procedure made returning from a short or long break from coding incredibly easy. It was born out of experiencing a repeated lack of motivation and overall friction when returning to work on a project.

This also works outside of coding as well. When I'm working on something complicated, it helps me leave that part of my mind at the work area, allowing it to rest, and being reassured that returning to my flow state is a few sentences away.
