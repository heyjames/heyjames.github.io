I learned how to start a dedicated server customized to my preferences like adjusting the map rotation and game timers. It required a lot of file management in Ubuntu, so I was able to practice using the terminal--moving, editing, renaming files, and retrieving filtered data from logs. My favorite was writing BASH scripts to automate simple commands to start, stop, restart, and detect server crashes. This led to an increase in server stability, uptime, and less maintenance.
## Tools
- Ubuntu Server
- BASH scripting
- C programming
- SSH with MobaXterm
- SFTP with FileZilla
- Vultr.com Virtual Private Server Cloud service
