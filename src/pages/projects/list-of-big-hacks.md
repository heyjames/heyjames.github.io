Inspired by <a href="https://blackfridaydeathcount.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Black Friday Death Count</a> <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i> and excitement in web development, I created a website that listed big hacking events. I learned to purchase and setup a domain and use Google App Engine to host the website.
