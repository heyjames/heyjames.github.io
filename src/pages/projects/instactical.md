When the sequel to Insurgency released, I started a community called INSTactical. There was a game server and website that players can follow to see server information, announcements, and blog posts. This was in the early stages of learning Node.js and MongoDB, so it was challenging and exciting to try programming tools that wasn't PHP and MySQL.

## Tools
- Node.js
- MongoDB
- Edge templating
- HTML
- Bulma CSS framework
